    """
    The multiprocessing.Pool sweep runner every real-scale measurement in this codebase's docs
    has hand-rolled independently - see docs/architecture/benchmarking.md. Dispatches one job per
    (config, seed) pair; worker_fn(shared_context, config, seed) must be a module-level function
    (not a local closure or lambda), the same picklability constraint ensemble_train.py's own
    worker functions already have, for the same reason - Pool workers receive tasks through a
    queue, which pickles whatever callable and arguments each task carries.

    shared_context is whatever read-only context every job needs in common (e.g. a
    benchmark_data.BenchmarkProxy built once by the caller before this call, or None if a worker
    needs no shared context at all) - passed explicitly through Pool's own initializer/initargs
    alongside worker_fn itself, pickled once per worker process, not per job. Deliberately
    explicit rather than the alternative of the caller stashing shared_context in a module-level
    global for worker_fn to read: that would only actually work under multiprocessing's fork
    start method (Linux's default, where a forked child inherits a copy of the parent's
    already-populated globals), silently breaking under spawn (macOS/Windows' default, where a
    spawned child re-imports the module fresh with none of the parent's mutations) - the same
    "pass every worker's context through explicit task/init arguments, never a fork-inherited
    global" idiom ensemble_train.py's own Pool workers already use, for exactly this portability
    reason.

    Each job receives a seed derived directly from `seeds` (not further reseeded from a parent
    random.Random the way ensemble_train.py's per-class jobs are, since here the caller already
    controls the exact seed list a sweep runs) - `worker_fn` itself is responsible for calling
    `random.seed(seed)`/`np.random.seed(seed)` as its own training path requires, exactly as
    every existing sweep script already does by hand.

    Progress is printed with flush=True as each job completes (when report_progress is True) -
    the concrete fix for a real gap found while running dropout's own stage-3 sweep: Python fully
    buffers stdout when it isn't a tty, so a per-job print() during a long run launched via
    run_in_background and redirected to a file would otherwise queue silently instead of showing
    interim progress.
