    The classifier's positive region is the intersection of its hidden nodes' half-planes,
    which may be bounded (closed, e.g. a triangle or other convex polygon) or unbounded
    (e.g. any single half-plane, or several whose intersection still extends to infinity).

    Returns the region's polygon vertices when it's bounded; an empty list when it's
    unbounded or empty.

    Only valid for an AND-combined classifier (required_active == cardinality) - the
    intersection-of-half-planes computed here is only actually the classifier's positive
    region under AND. For any other required_active (e.g. OR, or a general k-of-n gate),
    the true positive region is a union of such intersections, which this function does not
    compute; calling it on one would silently return a wrong polygon, so it's rejected
    outright instead.

    Also only valid for dimension == 2 - the polygon-clipping below only ever reads each
    hidden node's first two weights, so a classifier with more dimensions would otherwise be
    silently projected onto the first two and could report a completely wrong answer (e.g. a
    genuinely unbounded higher-dimensional region, like an infinite prism, reported as
    bounded because the dimensions extending it to infinity were never even looked at).

    huge defaults to a value derived from classifier.input_bounds (large enough that the
    initial clipping square's corners can never coincide with a real, bounded region's
    vertices) rather than a fixed constant - a fixed "large enough" absolute constant would
    itself be wrong at a large enough input_bounds scale, incorrectly reporting a genuinely
    bounded but large region as unbounded once its vertices approach that fixed constant.
