    """
    The dropout sibling of VectorizedMultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork - see
    docs/design-docs/array-siblings/dropout-array-layer.md. Hidden layers are built from DropoutArrayLayer (with
    drop_probability bound via a closure); the output layer stays the inherited plain ArrayLayer
    (sigmoid) - the array-level analogue of DropoutBackpropClassifierNetwork's own
    hidden_layer_cls-only override, matching DropoutNode's hidden-layer-only convention.

    drop_probability is a required constructor parameter, no default - the same posture
    DropoutBackpropClassifierNetwork's per-node counterpart already takes.

    _set_training_mode overrides the base class's no-op hook to actually toggle every hidden
    layer's own set_training_mode - the one real behavioral fork in this sibling, not a swapped
    layer class. self.hidden_layers (self.layers[:-1] - self.layers[-1] is always the output
    layer, per ArrayNetworkBase.__init__'s own construction order) is kept as a real attribute,
    not just a local slice, since it's also part of this class's own public surface (tests
    inspect it directly to confirm training mode resets between calls). learn/learn_batch's
    train/eval bracketing (set_training_mode(True)/try/finally around the forward pass only, not
    the whole method - see the original per-node design's own reasoning in
    docs/features/dropout.md) is now inherited from ArrayNetworkBase unchanged, free once this
    hook does something.
